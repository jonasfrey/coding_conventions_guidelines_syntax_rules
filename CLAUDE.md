Your invention is a programming/naming methodology.
Such ideas usually cannot be patented unless they create a concrete technical effect (e.g., measurable performance improvement).

Trade secret protection is no longer viable because you already published it as open source.

Your current goal is recognition, not control or monetization.

Best strategy for recognition:

Create a formal, structured paper describing the methodology.

Publish it on a permanent, citable platform like Zenodo (ideal because it gives a DOI).

Optionally also publish on arXiv.

Clearly state authorship and first publication date.

Provide a citation format so others can reference you properly.

You do not need an academic degree to publish papers, submit to conferences, or upload to repositories.

Long-term recognition comes from:

Clear definition of the idea

Formal documentation

Public talks or writings

Other people citing your work
